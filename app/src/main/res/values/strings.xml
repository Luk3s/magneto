    <string name="IdentificationExampleActivity_description">
        Choose a position close enough to the compass sensor, called the guessing position.
        Place three different magnets on the guessing position, one at a time.
        For each of them, tap the right name to store the sensed magnitude.
        Once all the magnitudes have been stores, place one of the magnets in the guessing position.
        The activity will guess which one you put.</string>

    <string name="PositionExampleActivity_description">
        For this activity we used a common switch. We embedded a magnet in the switch, so that when
        switched the magnet changes position. Place the switch in its final position.
        Tap on the "off" and "on" buttons when the switch is in the corresponding state to store
        the magnetic field sensed along the axes. As soon as you stored both of them, the activity starts.
        Modify the threshold if the test does not give a correct result.</string>

    <string name="LinearMotionExampleActivity_description">Place the slider close to the compass.
        Remember that both the device and the slider have to be still for this activity to work.
        Put the magnet on one end of the straight line and press the corresponding button to store
        the magnitude sensed by the device in that point. Repeat the process for the other end.
        An optimal position of the slider is one where the magnetic field sensed continually
        increases or decrease (read the documentation for more information).</string>

    <string name="VirtualTapExampleActivity_description">Choose a position around the compass for
        the magnet. Tap the start button. Flip the magnet in order to change the image shown.
        It is possible to change the position of the magnet during the activity. Depending on the
        positions, most of the times everything will work as expected.</string>

    <string name="RadialPositionExampleActivity_title">Radial Position</string>
    <string name="RadialPositionExampleActivity_description">While you move a magnet around the
        compass sensor, you can see a red dot representing its position on a circle. If the red
        dot is in an incorrect position, simply flip the magnet to change the side it faces the
        device. To track its distance from the sensor, store the magnetic field sensed when the
        magnet is far from the phone and it is right over the compass.</string>

    <string name="RapidChangesExampleActivity_title">Rapid Changes</string>
    <string name="RapidChangesExampleActivity_description">The activity detects rapid changes
        of the magnetic field, usually a consequence of flip-like actions and fast movements of
        a magnet nearby the compass sensor. A low and high threshold are defined. When the sensed
        high-pass filtered euclidean norm of the magnetic field is higher than the high threshold, a
        rapid change in the magnetic field is detected. In order to detect a new rapid change, the
        sensed euclidean norm should fall below the low threshold and become higher than the high
        one. The thresholds have to be chosen carefully, , they are not universal and depend on the
        strength of the magnet, how close it is to the sensor and how fast the field changes in
        relation to the magnet movement.</string>

    <string name="CollectSensorDataActivity_description">The activity can be used to store
        sensed values of the magnetic field (for example while using a slider, you can save
        the magnetic field values in some equidistant points). Choose a number from the picker,
        tap on "set Number of Points", then tap on "Record a Position" to temporary store the
        sensed value. If you want to update a previously stored value, simply tap on it to update
        the temporary stored value. To save all the values as CSV file in memory, simply tap on
        "Save as CSV". \n Recorded points appear below.</string>
